## Project Description
My Final Project is To Build a portable Raspberry Pi mini-computer with a battery pack and a small display. When completion of this project i will be able to turn on a Raspberry Pi with the battery pack i attached to it. The small display will be touchscreen so i will be able to navigate and browse around with just the tap of my finger. To put it into simpler terms i will be turning a Raspberry Pi to a "portable mini tablet".


## Project hardware and software requirements
* Raspberry Pi
* Small display
* Batter pack
* sd card
* Case for the Raspberry Pi

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open source Operating system. Unlike windows and mac os you can personalize the os to your liking. Linux has many distributions but the most popular ones are Debian, Fedora, and ubuntu.
