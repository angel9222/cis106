# Week Report 2
## Summary of Presentations: Virtualization and The Raspberry Pi
The presentation for week 2 was the basics of virtualization, how to use virtualbox, how to install Ubunto and what is a raspberry pi.

Virtualization is a replication of hardware to simulate a virtual machine inside a real machine.

There are two different types of virtualization which are server-side virtualization and client-side virtualization.
Some of the benefits of virtualization are:
* It allows running multiple OSs on one machine
* Allows applications to be tested before intalling it in the host machine
* It lets you experiment with untested programs
