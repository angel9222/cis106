# Weekly Report 3
## Summary of Presentation
### Navigating the filesystem
The file system is the ways files are stored and organized to simplify access to data. in this presentation we go over how to navigate in the filesystem by using commands in the terminal. Some of the commands are:

|Commands | what it does | Examples  |
|---------|--------------| ----------|
|cd       |Used for changing the current working directory | cd + destination, cd downloads(home directory to downloads directory) |
|Pwd      |used for displaying the current working directory |  just type in pwd and it will display where you are currently |
|ls       |used for displaying all the files inside a given directory | ls -a is to list all the files inside the current working directory

* File system -the ways files are stored and organized to simplify access to data.
* Current directory - The directory where you are at in the moment.
* parent directory - inside a particular directory you can move forward to a subdirectory ot backwards.
 *  your home directory vs the home directory - 'your home directory' refers to your user's home directory. The home directory refers to the home directory located in the root.
* pathname - indicates the location of the file in the filesystem.
* relative path - The location of a file starting from a current working directory.
* absolute path - the location of a file staring at the root of the file system.

The right to repair movement is us as the consumers of products having the ability to access the hardware on devices. This matters or should matter because not everyone has the money to buy the same product over and over again every time that it breaks.
